# AI-Driven Credit Risk Assessment for Banking: Predicting Bankruptcy with Machine Learning

## Overview
Bankruptcy prediction is a critical tool for financial institutions, investors, and risk managers. This project leverages machine learning models to assess corporate financial health, reducing risk exposure and enhancing portfolio decision-making. Using the **Polish Companies Bankruptcy Dataset (2000–2013)**, this model evaluates key financial indicators to classify firms as financially stable or at risk of bankruptcy. This project achieved **96.01% accuracy using Calibrated XGBoost**, demonstrating a scalable approach to modern credit risk evaluation and financial health assessment.

**Why Calibrated XGBoost?**  
By applying Isotonic Regression, the calibrated XGBoost model improves probability estimates, making it more effective for financial decision-making where precision and recall must be balanced.

## **Feature Importance: What Drives Bankruptcy Risk?**
This model identifies the most influential financial ratios in predicting bankruptcy using XGBoost’s gain-based ranking.
What does "gain" mean?
- **Gain measures how much a feature improves the model’s accuracy when used in decision-making.**
- **A higher gain score means the feature is more critical in predicting bankruptcy risk.**

## **Top 10 Features Influencing Bankruptcy Predictions**
1. **Return on Assets = Net Profit / Total Assets**  
2. **Liabilities Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets**  
3. **Cash Ratio**  
4. **Net Working Capital Ratio = Working Capital / Total Assets**  
5. **Basic Earning Power = EBIT / Total Assets**  
6. **Debt Repayment Ratio**  
7. **Asset Turnover Ratio = Sales / Total Assets**  
8. **Equity Ratio = Equity / Total Assets**  
9. **Short-Term Profitability Ratio = Gross Profit / Short-Term Liabilities**  
10. **Retained Earnings Ratio = Retained Earnings / Total Assets**

## What Did We Learn from the Model Outputs?

Based on the model outputs and evaluation metrics, several key insights emerged:

- **Data Imbalance is a Major Challenge:** The dataset is highly imbalanced, with far fewer bankruptcy cases than non-bankruptcy cases. This makes recall for the minority class (bankrupt companies) difficult to optimize, as seen in the low recall scores for most models.

- **SMOTE Improves Minority Class Representation:** Applying SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) helped balance the classes, allowing models to better learn patterns associated with bankruptcy, though perfect recall remains elusive.

- **Model Performance Varies Significantly:**
    - Logistic Regression and SVM achieved high overall accuracy but performed poorly in identifying bankrupt companies (very low recall and F1-score for the minority class).
    - Random Forest and KNN improved precision but still struggled with recall.
    - XGBoost and especially Calibrated XGBoost provided the best balance, with much higher recall and F1-score for the minority class, while maintaining high overall accuracy.

- **Feature Engineering and Imputation are Crucial:** Handling missing values and selecting the most informative features significantly impacted model performance and stability.

- **Calibrated XGBoost is the Best Performer:** Calibrated XGBoost, using Isotonic Regression for probability calibration, achieved the best results in terms of both accuracy and minority class recall/F1-score, making it the most suitable for real-world financial risk assessment where identifying bankruptcies is critical.

- **Interpretability and Further Tuning Needed:** While the best model performs well, further work is needed to improve interpretability (using SHAP/LIME) and to boost recall for the minority class, possibly through advanced sampling or ensemble techniques.
